The LicenseKit website is now live and what better way to celebrate than to make LicenseKit available as closed beta. This post explains how the closed beta program is setup.


## Features

LicenseKit currently supports all major Apple platforms (iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS) and can be used to protect your libraries and apps with a local license engine that is configured with local licenses.

The local license engine lets you configure hard-coded licenses with code, which means that you must release new binaries to add more licenses. LicenseKit will be extended with remote license validation in later versions.


## Tiers

LicenseKit has two initial license tiers, which aim at indie developers and companies. Pricing and setup may change later as more features are added, but these are the two tiers that are available for the closed beta.


## How to join the closed beta

Joining the closed beta will let you use LicenseKit free of charge, with a significant discount after the beta program ends. LicenseKit licenses are currently obtained from [this page](/licenses). 


## Contact

The closed beta program is pretty experimental, so things may change as time passes. Just [reach out](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=LicenseKit Closed Beta) if you have questions or feedback or would like to join the program.
