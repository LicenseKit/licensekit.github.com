The Indie tier is aimed at indie developers with few users, while the Company tier is aimed at commercial software with many users. 

Licenses are purchased using your preferred method of payment (Bank Transfer, Xoom etc.). Just [send an e-mail](mailto:{{site.email}}?subject=LicenseKit License) and we'll discuss your needs.
